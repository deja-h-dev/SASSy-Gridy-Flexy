    <h1>SASSy, Griddy, Flexy</h1>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to my second webpage project!</p>
  
    <p>On this episode of Deja Dev, I'm relearning how to use SASS, CSS Grid, and Flexbox! It took me longer than I care to admit to install and set up SASS. While doing so, I managed to break my computer... Twice... Don't ask me how. On the bright side, I have a clean install of Windows 11!</p>
  
    <p>Anyway, I'm going to separate this page into three sections. This is the first section. The next section will be a row of cards. And the final section will be a photo grid. I'm also going to be referencing SASS Basics to learn how to set variables, nest styles, create partials etc... </p>
  
    <p>Lets get started!</p>
